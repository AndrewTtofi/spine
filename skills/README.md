# Skills

The lifecycle loop. Each skill reads from and writes to the Spine (`.spine/`).

- **[init](./init/SKILL.md)** — Bootstrap the `.spine/` store; detect the stack, seed context/conventions/journal.
- **[align](./align/SKILL.md)** — Grill intent until acceptance criteria are crisp, before building.
- **[design](./design/SKILL.md)** — Turn criteria into a concrete architecture (deep modules, ADRs) before code.
- **[build](./build/SKILL.md)** — Implement features as small TDD vertical slices that follow your conventions.
- **[verify](./verify/SKILL.md)** — Check work against the criteria with real evidence before claiming done.
- **[ship](./ship/SKILL.md)** — Land verified work as a clean branch + PR, with a body drawn from the Spine.
- **[troubleshoot](./troubleshoot/SKILL.md)** — Root-cause a bug — investigate, reproduce, fix — and record the lesson.
- **[remember](./remember/SKILL.md)** — Distill the session back into the Spine so the next one starts informed.

Meta:

- **[new-skill](./new-skill/SKILL.md)** — Scaffold a new spine skill, wired and validator-green.

Fundraising track (optional) — reads from and writes to `.spine/raise/`, a
namespace separate from the engineering Spine. Opt in with `raise-init`.

- **[raise-init](./raise-init/SKILL.md)** — Bootstrap `.spine/raise/`; seed the startup profile via interview.
